# A-Comprehensive-Guide-to-K-Means-and-Hierarchical-Clustering
This guide covers the basics and applications of K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, highlighting their differences and practical uses. Perfect for both beginners and experienced data scientists.
## K-Means Clustering
K-Means is a partition-based clustering algorithm that divides data into a previously specified number of 
clusters, represented as (k). In this algorithm, each data point iteratively assigns to the closest cluster 
center, known as the centroid, and then it does an update of the centroids until convergence. This 
simplicity in approach has made K-Means highly efficient for use with large datasets
## Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering, on the other hand, is a tree-based method that builds a hierarchy of clusters in a 
tree-like structure called a dendrogram. The hierarchy inherent in the cluster allows for different levels of 
granularity in the clustering, and it is easy to explore the data at higher or lower levels. Unlike K-Means, 
hierarchical clustering does not require pre-specifying the number of clusters.
## Comparison between K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering:
✔ K-Means is fast and scalable, making it a good choice for large datasets where the number of 
clusters is known.
✔ Hierarchical Clustering provides a more flexible and interpretable structure, which is useful for 
smaller datasets or when exploring data at different levels of granularity.
## Use of Iris Dataset
Iris Dataset is one of the classic datasets in the machine learning community and is commonly used in 
teaching clustering and classification algorithms. It includes 150 samples of iris flowers-three species: 
Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica where each sample is described by four numeric features:
● Sepal Length
● Sepal Width
● Petal Length
● Petal Width
## Data Preprocessing
Clustering algorithm applications have to be prepared for data preprocessing before applying these to the 
Iris dataset. Preprocessing of the dataset cleans it, hence standardizing it and getting the dataset ready for 
clustering. 
## Applying Clustering Algorithms
Now that the dataset is preprocessed, we can apply K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
## Visualizing the Results
Following the clustering of data using K-Means and Hierarchical clustering, visual inspection of the 
cluster from both algorithms will be required to ascertain how each algorithm has fared in the grouping of 
the data. In this section, we shall visualize the resulting clusters by use of matplotlib and seaborn's scatter 
plots that will show points in a scatter plot classified under their respective cluster labels
